                                    <p>Personal Data: “Personal Data” means data that allows someone to identify you, including, for example, your name, address, telephone and mobile numbers, e-mail address, as well as any information about you that is associated with or linked to, or could be linked to, any of the foregoing data. “Anonymous Data” means data that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Data. Anonymous Data does not permit the identification of individual persons. We collect Personal Data and Anonymous Data from you when you visit our website or when you send us information or communications.</p>
                                    <p>How we collect Personal Data: We collect Personal Data from you, such as your name, address, email, and phone number when you complete a form on our site. We also collect other types of Personal Data that you provide to us voluntarily, when, for instance, we contact you in response to your request.</p>
                                    <p>Cookies: “Cookies” are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing a website. We use cookies to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our sites. You have the ability to accept or delete cookies, but please be aware that for some parts of our site to work, you will need to accept cookies.

Following recent revisions of the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 relating to the notification and use of cookies we are currently working towards implementing the new requirements in line with guidance provided by the Information Commissioner’s Office.</p>
                                    <p>How we use the information we collect: We use the Personal Data you provide to us online to contact you in response to your request.

                                    <p>How we share your personal data: If you provide us with Personal Data in connection with a case evaluation, we may share it with one or more participating law firms. We may also share your Personal Data with our contractors, affiliates, and marketing partners if you have expressed an interest in the products or services they provide, or have otherwise given us permission to do so. You expressly consent to the sharing of your Personal Data with our contractors and service providers for the purpose of providing services to you.
