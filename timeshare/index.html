                <p>Legal timeshare cancellation is easier in 2018 than it used to be. Many resorts have opened
                    “take-back” programs that allow distressed timeshare owners to give their timeshare back to the
                    resort developer. These programs are not available to all, but they are a good start.</p>
                <p>If you own a timeshare with a brand or resort that doesn’t have an exit solution, you’ll need to
                    either sell the timeshare, stop paying the maintenance fees and take the hit to your credit, or hire
                    the assistance of a timeshare exit company. If you’re ready to get some assistance you’ve come to
                    the right place.</p>

                            We will primarily use your PII to provide product or service offerings to you. We will also
                            use certain forms of PII to enhance the operation of our Site, improve our internal
                            marketing and promotional efforts, statistically analyze Site use, improve our product and
                            service offerings, and customize our Site’s content, layout, and services. We may use PII to
                            deliver information to you and to contact you regarding administrative notices. Finally, we
                            may use your PII to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our agreements with
                            you, including our Site Terms of Use, and this Privacy Policy. We may also collect certain
                            Aggregate Information. For example, we may use your IP address to diagnose problems with our
                            servers, software, to administer our Site and to gather demographic information. </p>
                        <p>Cookies. Depending on how you use our Site, we will store cookies on your computer in order
                            to collect certain aggregate data about our users and to customize certain aspects of your
                            specific user experience. A cookie is a small data text file which is stored on your
                            computer that uniquely identifies your browser. Cookies may also include more personalized
                            information, such as your IP address, browser type, the server your computer is logged onto,
                            the area code and zip code associated with your server, and your first name to welcome you
                            back to our Site. We may use cookies to perform tasks such as: monitoring aggregate site
                            usage metrics, storing and remembering your passwords (if you allow us to do so), storing
                            account and advertising preferences that you have set, and personalizing the Services we
                            make available to you. However, we do not use cookies to track your browsing behaviors. Most
                            browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse
                            all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some aspects of the Site
                            may not function properly if you elect to disable cookies.</p>
                        <p>Release of Information. We will not sell, trade, or rent your PII to others outside our
                            corporate family. We do provide some of our product and service offerings through
                            contractual arrangements made with affiliates, service providers, partners and other third
                            parties (“Service Partners”). We and our Service Partners may need to use some PII in order
                            to perform tasks between our respective sites, or to deliver products or services to you.
                            For example, we must release your credit card information to the card-issuing bank to
                            confirm payment for products and services purchased on this Site; release your address
                            information to the delivery service to deliver products that you ordered; and provide order
                            information to third parties that help us provide customer service.</p>
                        <p>We will encourage our Service Partners to adopt and promote strong privacy policies. However,
                            the use of your PII by our Service Partners is governed the respective privacy policies of
                            those providers, and is not subject to our control. Except as otherwise discussed in this
                            Privacy Policy, this document only addresses the use and disclosure of information we
                            collect from you. Other Sites accessible through this Site, including our Advertising and
                            Service Partners, have their own privacy policies and data collection, use and disclosure
                            practices. Please consult each Site’s privacy policy. We are not responsible for the
                            policies or practices of third parties.
                            Occasionally we may be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide PII to
                            the appropriate governmental authorities. In such cases, we will disclose PII upon receipt
                            of a court order, subpoena, or to cooperate with a law enforcement investigation. We fully
                            cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our services for
                            illegal activities. We reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any
                            activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful.
                        </p>
                        <p>We may also provide Aggregate Information about our customers’ sales, traffic patterns, and related Site information to third party advertisers, but these statistics do not include any Personally Identifiable Information.</p>
                        <p>User Choices on Collection and Use of Information. We may, from time to time, send you email regarding products and services that we feel may interest you. In addition, if you indicated upon registration that you are interested in receiving offers or information from us and our partners, we may occasionally call or send you direct mail about products and services that may be of interest to you. Only Company (or agents working on behalf of Company and under confidentiality agreements) will send you these solicitations, and only if you have previously indicated that you wish to receive them. If you do not want to receive solicitations from us, you can “opt-out” by accessing your account online editing your account information to no longer receive such offers and mailings. You also have choices with respect to cookies, as described above. By modifying your browser preferences, you have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies. If you choose to reject all cookies some parts of our Site may not work properly in your case.</p>
                        <p>Security of Your PII. At our Site you can be assured that your PII is secure, consistent with current industry standards. We strive to take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of your PII. For example:</p>
                        <p class="dots">We work hard to ensure that the data we collect is reliable, accurate, complete and current. We encrypt all PII, in order to prevent unauthorized parties from viewing such information when it is transmitted to us. We also only keep collected information only for as long as reasonably necessary and use it only for the purposes for which it was collected or to comply with any applicable legal or ethical reporting or document retention requirements.</p>
                        <p class="dots">We limit access to PII only to specific employees, contractors and agents who have a reasonable need to come into contact with your information. For example, we may provide members of our technical support team with limited access to your account in order to allow them to troubleshoot problems you may be having with the Site. </p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your PII, you acknowledge that: (a) there are security and privacy limitations inherent to the Internet which are beyond our control; and (b) the security, integrity and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and us through this Site cannot be guaranteed.</p>
                        <p>Miscellaneous.  You must be at least 18 years old to have our permission to use this Site. Our policy is that we do not knowingly collect, use or disclose PII about minor visitors. You should also be aware that when Personally Identifiable Information is voluntarily disclosed (i.e. your name, email address, etc.) in the discussion forums or other public areas on this Site, that information, along with any information disclosed in your communication, can be collected and used by third parties and may result in unsolicited messages (including unwanted spam messages) from third parties. Such activities are beyond our control and this Policy does not apply to such information. Please consult our Site Terms and Conditions of Use Agreement for our Site Conduct policies. </p>
                        <p>If you have any questions, concerns or inquiries about our Privacy Policy, or our use of your PII, or our privacy practices, please contact us.</p>
